**Original Data**: 

The [original data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/data) can be retrieved from Kaggle. We worked with Kaggle Notebooks that make it easy to load the data right from the Kaggle backend.

**JPEGs**: 

Since we did model protoyping, we did not use the original data but a [smaller pre-processed subset for rapid prototyping](https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/cleaning-the-data-for-rapid-prototyping-fastai) created by Jeremy Howard on Kaggle.
